# Water level surveillance/monitoring.

### Overview
This Android Things app measures the water level at fixed intervals, then displays the values collected in the console. The app also sends the sensor data to a javascript server which holds all the data recorded so far. Finally, an angular server receives the sensor data and creates the column chart.
